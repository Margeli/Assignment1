## Game Description

Map tiles and character sprites art are from  [Open Art](https://opengameart.org/), both free without copyright. 
This game has been developed for game developement subject by Carles Margelí and Roger Sanchez in 2017. 
The game main goal is to reach the end of the levels collecting as many bananas as possible and trying to achieve a high score. 
In the way, the player will find three diferent types of trolls and some anoying flyes that will try to kill you. 
The player will have five hearts or health points. Once those hearts are over, the player will die and lose his current puntuation and bananas. Also there is a time conuter in the UI. When pressing escape ingame, the user will go to a pause menu. This is an extra innovation to the game. 
Killing enemies and picking bananas gives points. Every 100 points the player will recover an extra life. 
There is a main menu with credits with a link to the repository, and settings with music and FX volume handler. Two diferent levels with increasing dificulty. 

## Tips 

- For the gameplay, a useful key is left shift, wich makes the kinght run.
- Jump above the enemies to kill them. 
- Get points to recover hearts.

## Team members
